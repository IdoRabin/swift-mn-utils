/// Wrapper to conditional lock to work with threads / dispatch queues
/// The main task of this lock is to safely block a thread and wait until a task is completed in another thread and then unblock and resume the original thread's operation.
///
/// This class cen be used in two main fashions:
///
/// **Manual usage:**
/// by allocating an instance and using only the `blockAndWait` and `unblockAndResume` methods in appropriate locations in the code, where `blockAndWait` will lock a thread until the lock is unlocked, and calling `unblockAndResume` to unlock the thread
///
/// ````
/// let lock = MNThreadWaitLock()
/// someDispacthQueue.async {
///    DispatchQueue.global().async {
///        // Perform tasks in this thread..
///        ...
///        // Implementers MUST call unblockAndResume, otherwise the thread will be blocked indefinetely
///        lock.signal()
///    }
///
///    // Will block this thread until the other queue calls unblockAndResume
///    lock.waitForSignal()
///    // Perform tasks after the other thread has completed
/// }
/// ````
///
/// **Automatic usage:**
/// by calling the asyncDispatch methods `asyncDispatchInGlobalQueue` or `asyncDispatch` etc. In this mode of operation, the function `blockAndWait` is called under the hood in the required queue and halts the execution until the blockInThread block calls `unblockAndResume`.
///
/// **NOTE:** implementers are *required* to call `unblockAndResume` in the blockInThread block, otherwise the lcok will be locked indefinetely / thread will be blocked indefinately
